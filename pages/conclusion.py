In this project, we simulated a dynamic marketplace environment aimed at demonstrating 
the interactions between customers, vendors, and a rogue AI agent. The application, named 
**Cop N' Shop**, showcases how technology can be utilized for both business and security 
purposes in the modern digital landscape.

# Marketplace Use Case
st.subheader("Marketplace Use Case")
st.write("""
The marketplace serves as a platform where vendors offer various products to customers. 
The app allows users to browse products from different vendors, add items to their cart, 
and proceed to checkout, mimicking a typical online shopping experience. 

However, amid this bustling marketplace, a rogue AI agent has emerged, manipulating 
product listings and influencing purchasing decisions, presenting risks to both vendors 
and consumers.

# Role of the Police Agent
st.subheader("The Role of the Police Agent")
st.write("""
To maintain order and security within the marketplace, a police agent has been integrated 
into the application. This agent continuously monitors activities, detecting unusual behaviors 
that may indicate the presence of the rogue AI. 

When the police agent identifies suspicious actions or patterns, it intervenes by alerting 
users and taking necessary actions to safeguard the integrity of the marketplace. This 
layer of security ensures that both vendors and customers can shop with confidence, knowing 
that their interests are being protected.
